Making Ken Silverman's "Voxlap" voxel graphics engine run on any platform
with SDL and C++.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Build Prerequisites:

Build Tools:
	Option 1
		MSVS utilities (nmake, ml, cl)
		Windows SDK (libs)
	Option 2
		MinGW/GCC
		Nasm in %MinGW%/bin
Graphics
	Option 1
		DirectX SDK (libs)
	Option 2
		SDL DEV-MinGW/GCC and RUNTIME (libs)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Quick Porting Progress Overview :

* -- Done | $ -- In Progress | # -- not started

1. Compile with MS Visual Studio 2010 utilities, and June 2010 DirectX sdk (*)
	* Makefile mead from *.c headers
	* Old DirectX SDK *.LIBs included
	* v5.asm modified as per
	  http://natural-satellite.com/2011/06/19/visual-studio-and-voxlap/
2. Use cross-platform assembler: (*)
	$ make v5.asm compile in NASM. [I give up on this]
	  Thanks, http://www.drpaulcarter.com/pcasm/
	  and http://www.devoresoftware.com/nomyso/
	* make v5.asm compile in JWASM. [I did this instead.]
	  JWASM uses MASM syntax, making this trivially easy.
	  Thanks person on ##ASM on freenode for giving me the idea.
		* Links with MSVC too
	# make macro to support both cdecl and stdcall naming conventions.
3. Compile with GCC/MinGW: ($)
	* Update makefile for MinGW
		* Move all program names, directories, and flags to macros
		* Add corresponding MinGW macro defs.
		* Makefile is now very modular
	* Convert all C++ to compile as both C and C++
	  This allows me to compare mscv and gcc versions more directly, as I the
	  ABI for C is more consistent between the two toolchains.
		# Bug: game in C does not allow weapons to be fired, but that shouldn't
		  be a voxlap issue.
	* Convert inline assembly to work with gcc
	  GCC now supports ".intel_syntax noprefix" making this much easier
		# make local variables work
		  for now, with intel syntax GCC treats all labels as global
	* Compiles
	# Link with ld
		# Fix Bugs
4. Compile on *NIX (Linux in my case) ($)
	* Compiles (including sdlmain
	# link
Alternative step 2:
2. Compiler on MSVC with minimal asm ($)
	$ Compile game without v5.asm (the only external assembly)
	$ Remove inline asm to simplify toolchain interoperability.
Misc
	* Heirarchy implemented. (Makefile ready; code needs to be adjusted so bin
	  and data don't need to be in same folder.)
	* .c to .cpp (until it all works as true C), accuracy is great.
	# PreMake? CMake? automake?



------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Introduction:

So, the basic idea is to get Ken Silverman's Voxlap voxel graphics engine to
run on just about any platform that supports C++ and SDL (DirectX is
still kept operational for windows). This all boils down to 2 fundamental
things: getting the code to compile in GCC, and making sure that now windows
libraries are in use.


Compiler issues:

The compiler part is pretty easy, except for one thing: the assembly code.
Voxlap uses both a single file of routines in assembly, and copious
amounts of inline assembly within it's C++ files. Now, most of this assembly
should be perfectly portable, but every compiler collection has a different
format for both external and internal assembly.

I say format, because converting from one to another is a fairly trivial task,
but not quite trivial enough where I can confidently do it with my limited
assembly knowledge in an error-free manor. I have tried various scripts to
convert assembly (inline and external), but the bottom line is that I don't
really trust them. Most significantly, v5.asm's nasm port won't work with MSVC
(though it should), so why should I trust it with GCC? Dealing with the inline
assembly is even simpler, but the conversion tools are correspondingly more
primitive, and I can't test them anyways until v5.asm works.

Therefore I HAD opted to dispense with assembly code altogether. Voxlap5 (the
main Voxlap code) is littered with commented out replacement C for various
assembly routines. Not all of it works as well as the assembly -- I think Ken
mainly used it as a guide for writing the assembly and didn’t debug it as
the program evolved -- but it’s certainly better than nothing. As to the
external assembly, there is a macro that’s supposed to let the program run
without it, but it leaves in a few missing linkages -- it was probably also
ignored as the program evolved. For better or worse, the inline assembly and
external assembly often relies on each other.  On one hand, this means taking
out one can help get rid of the other. On the other hand, it means it’s
very difficult to replace the assembly incrementally and debug as you go.

I learned of another assembly, JWASM, on IRC which is both cross-platform and
Supports NASM syntax as close as possible. This gave me the opportunity to go
back to my original plan of porting all the assembly. This of course came with
the added benefit of leaving the original program as intact as possible, and
utilizing the inline assembly that was admittedly still faster than the C. For
ARM ports it will still have to go but this seems to be the easier solution
for now. Now my plan is to work along both methods. I don't know whether
converting or removing inline assembly will get to a finished port faster, so
I've made a git branch for each method to work on both concurrently.

I was able to quickly fix the few syntax errors that existed, and get a
working Game.exe with MSVC and JWASM. But JWASM in itself did nothing to
prevent the link errors with MSVC external assembly together is often made
easier. The cacophony of link errors, was a bit hard to decipher, and in order
to better separate assembly-caused linking errors from other issues, I decided
to get the whole thing to be compiled as C. C, unlike C++, has no name
mangling, and in addition C-derived objects files made by different compilers
have a better chance of linking correctly (especially on windows). I figured
this would open up new doors testing.

I now have everything compiling and linking on Windows and Linux, MSVC and
gcc, and SDL on both platforms. Unfortunately however, when running a gcc
build on any platform some text is displayed on the screen. When I don't use
the -ffast-math flag, it will in addition crash due to arithmetic overflows.
Because this is thus strictly a compiler-caused issue, my guess is there is
still some mistake in the inline-assembly I converted to C. It is now clear to
me that in order to get this working, I will have to remove all inline
assembly. Because in many cases the C is less efficient, I will try to add it
back in after I have fixed most bugs. But the only way to rigorously cross-
reference the MSVC and gcc builds/bugs, I must avoid as much compiler-specific
syntax as I can. I imagine once I reach the point where it is safe to again
experiment with assembly, asm and no-asm versions will be developed with some
independence, and the benchmarks will state which branch to focus on.


Library issues:

I can't really dive into this until the former step is complete, but it seems
that again a good bit of the work is already done.

Voxlap itself is a surprisingly self-contained beast, primary because it’s
a software render so it only uses DirectX to copy frame buffers and other
trivial stuff. The backend it currently uses Winmain, is not Voxlap-Specific,
but rather used by a couple of Ken’s things (maybe even the build engine).

On the flip side, the example game, and probably other games based around
Voxlap don’t just use voxlap’s header, but also directly use Sysmain.h,
Winmain’s interface. So to have a genuinely useful Voxlap port, seemingly
unused features of Sysmain.h must also be ported.

Thankfully, available on Ken’s site is SDLmain, a non-Voxlap-Specific
port of Winmain. I’m not sure how complete it is, but I’d hope it has
the most basic stuff that Voxlap itself requires available. The more progress
I've made, the more I been able to validate the SDLmain basically works as
advertised. Now that I have the Voxlap building with SDLmain and MSVC, I am
almost sure it will hardly need modification.

The other example programs besides 'game' use some GDI and other Windows-
specific APIs not abstracted in Winmain, so I will not focus on porting them
for the time being. I did recently however add Slab6 to my code base, as it
shares both Winmain code that later ended up in Voxlap. To fully incorporate
it I will need to deal with these other windows dependencies, so doing so is
definitely on the agenda.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What Next:

A true port should change as little of the old program as possible in order to
maintain maximal compatibility. At the same time, porting is a perfect time to
introduce deep architectural changes into a program. I believe a few obvious
improvements that would not effect existing programs ability to interface with
Voxlap to much extent.

Voxlap is a library, nothing more, nothing less. As such it should be able to
be both statically and dynamically linked with another program. Currently,
only static linking is tested to work, but with a couple trivial changes,
dynamic linking should be too.

Voxlap is C++, but in name only. In practice it contains little-to-none
Object-Oriented components, and only a few C++ idiosyncrasies prevent it from
being compiled as C. In fact, it even contains a couple of preprocessor
conditionals to test for C or C++ completion. Ideally it should fully support
being compiled as C or C++ in order to work in many situations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
License:

Based on my concept of a “true port” I should keep the license the same
as the original: basically attribution + non-commercial only without Ken
Silverman’s explicit permission. I previously stated here my work could be
licensed with the LGPL provided Ken's restrictions are also followed, but I
now see that is not possible due to the GPL's requirement that commercial
distribution *must* be permitted.

As before, Ken's licensing restrictions must be obeyed. If  obtains
permission to use Ken's code under different terms, he or she must also
contact me and obtain permission if they want to use my modifications.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Acknowledgements:

Freenode IRC network: It about as indispensable a resource as exists for
programming these days. #C and especially #asm in particular for this project.
Many people on the network offered excellent advice, and copious amounts of
patience and time, but I'd especially like to thank:
	- vulture: (on #asm) for helping me get v5 to change memory permissions on
	  Linux for the sake of self-modifying code.

[Original] Voxlap engine notes by Ken Silverman (http://advsys.net/ken)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Introduction:

The Voxlap engine includes all the tools you need to create your own game
using a high-speed software voxel engine. I have included 4 applications:

   * GAME: An unfinished sample game
   * SIMPLE: Minimalist application code to help get you started.
   * VOXED: My voxel world editor
   * KWALK: My voxel model animation editor

I compiled the code with Microsoft Visual C/C++ 6.0. It should work with later
versions of Visual C. If you don't have a copy of MSVC, you can download the
VC 2003 Toolkit from Microsoft. (See note in requirements).

After unzipping, the first thing you should do is look at this file :) First,
I'll describe my way of compiling. I like to compile at the command line. To
set up your VC environment, run VCVARS32.BAT (as described at the top of
MAKESTUF.BAT) Then in MAKESTUF.BAT, check to make sure your directories are
set up correctly. Make sure your environment variables (lib and include)
point to the right path. You'll need them to point to the Visual C directories
as well as the directories from the DirectX SDK. Once this is done, you are
ready to run MAKESTUF.BAT. I put an in-line makefile at the top of each source
file. This is why there is no "makefile" in the directory. Cool trick, eh?

You can compile the examples from the VC GUI environment as well, but you'll
need to create your own project if you do so. Here are some hints on setting it
up to compile Voxlap:

   * Be sure to specify these non-default compiler settings:
	/J   default char type is unsigned
	/TP  compile all files as .cpp (I incorrectly use .c to save typing :)

   * Add these libraries to your linker settings:
	ddraw.lib
	dinput.lib
	dxguid.lib

   * To compile V5.ASM, you'll need an assembler. I use MASM. I'm not quite
	sure how to set this up in the VC environment. To make things easier,
	I included V5.OBJ. You can add this to your project if you have
	trouble assembling V5.ASM.

To compile with VC Toolkit 2003:
   * Change the linker option: /MD to /ML
	(see top of GAME.C, SIMPLE.C, VOXED.C, KWALK.C)

   * To fix the "MSVCRT.LIB not found" error, in WINMAIN.CPP, change:
      #define USETHREADS 20
	 To:
      #define USETHREADS 0

Requirements:

   CPU: Pentium III, Athlon, or above
   System memory: 128MB RAM or above
   Graphics card: Any old piece of junk should be fine :)
   OS: Microsoft Windows 98/ME/2K/XP
   DirectX 8.0 or above
   Compiler: Microsoft Visual C/C++ 6.0 or above.

   NOTE: WINMAIN.CPP uses SSE or 3DNow! instructions, so if you are compiling
   with VC6, you will need to install the Processor Pack (VCPP.ZIP). VCPP
   will only install over VC6 SP5 Professional edition, although I have had
   some success in fooling the installation program :) Fortunately, this is
   not an issue with VC7. You can also download a "free" version of the VC
   compiler: google for "c++ toolkit 2003". Unfortunately, it's missing a few
   files, such as WINDOWS.H and NMAKE.EXE, but they can be found elsewhere -
   either from the Platform SDK, or by googling for them.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
File description:

MAKESTUF.BAT: Quick&dirty batch file showing how to compile things at the
   command prompt.
SIMPLE.C: Minimalist sample code showing how to interface Voxlap. Study this
   code before looking at GAME.C. It should also be easier to start a new
   project from this code.
GAME.*: A big ugly testing ground for many Voxlap features. Think of this
   as the example code for most functions in VOXLIB.TXT.

VOXLAP5.H: Include file for VOXLAP5.C, V5.ASM, KPLIB.C
VOXLAP5.C: Voxlap engine C routines
V5.*: Voxlap engine assembler routines
KPLIB.C: Ken's Picture LIBrary. Decoding for: PNG,JPG,GIF,TGA,BMP,PCX and ZIP.
   This library can be used independently from the engine. Voxlap depends on
   this library for various functions.
WINMAIN.CPP: Windows layer (setup screen, sound, input). This code is
   independent of Voxlap and can be replaced if you want to use your own
   windows layer, such as SDL. I've been maintaining WINMAIN.CPP for years, so
   it is rather stable now.
SYSMAIN.H: Include file for my windows layer (WINMAIN)
VOXDATA.ZIP: Game data. You do not need to extract this data to run GAME.EXE,
   SIMPLE.EXE, or VOXED.EXE. You will need to extract it to select models for
   loading in KWALK though.

VOXED.*: My VXL voxel editor. I made UNTITLED.VXL using VOXED. There are a lot
   of keys to learn - so have patience. As a convenience, you can view the
   help file (VOXEDHLP.TXT) inside the editor by pressing F1.
KWALK.*: An animation editor for .KV6 voxel sprites using .KFA animations.
   You'll need to extract files from VOXDATA.ZIP to see my example models.

VXLFORM.TXT: Description of the VXL format
KWALKHLP.TXT: Help file for KWALK
VOXEDHLP.TXT: Help file for VOXED
VOXLIB.TXT: Help file for VOXLAP5, KPLIB, and WINMAIN.
