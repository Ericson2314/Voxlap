Porting notes by Ericson2314
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Making Ken Silverman's Voxlap voxel graphics engine MinGW compatible, then
*NIX compatible.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Porting Progress:

* -- Done | $ -- In Progress | # -- not started

1. Compile with MS Visual Studio 2010 utilities, and June 2010 DirectX sdk (*)
    * Makefile mead from *.c headers
    * Old DirectX SDK *.LIBs included
    * v5.asm modified as per
        http://natural-satellite.com/2011/06/19/visual-studio-and-voxlap/
2. Compile with MinGW ($)
    $ make v5.asm compile in NASM. Thanks, http://www.drpaulcarter.com/pcasm/
      and http://www.devoresoftware.com/nomyso/
        * Compiles & Links
        $ Fix Bugs
            $ ?Word to Dword
            $ Incorrect bracketing
            # Other
    # Inline asm: convert to at&t syntax or make seperate and nasm
    * Update makefile for MinGW
        * Move all program names, directories, and flags to macros
        * Add Corosponing MinGW macro defs.
    # Fix Bugs
3. Compile without Direct X (#)
    # Swap winmain.cpp for sdlmain.cpp
    # Winelib?
4. Compile on *NIX (Linux in my case) (#)
Misc
    * Heirarchy implemented. (Makefile ready; code needs to be adjusted so bin
      and data don't need to be in same folder.)
    * .c to .cpp, accuracy is great.
    # PreMake? CMake? autobuild?

[Original] Voxlap engine notes by Ken Silverman (http://advsys.net/ken)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Introduction:

The Voxlap engine includes all the tools you need to create your own game
using a high-speed software voxel engine. I have included 4 applications:

   * GAME: An unfinished sample game
   * SIMPLE: Minimalist application code to help get you started.
   * VOXED: My voxel world editor
   * KWALK: My voxel model animation editor

I compiled the code with Microsoft Visual C/C++ 6.0. It should work with later
versions of Visual C. If you don't have a copy of MSVC, you can download the
VC 2003 Toolkit from Microsoft. (See note in requirements).

After unzipping, the first thing you should do is look at this file :) First,
I'll describe my way of compiling. I like to compile at the command line. To
set up your VC environment, run VCVARS32.BAT (as described at the top of
MAKESTUF.BAT) Then in MAKESTUF.BAT, check to make sure your directories are
set up correctly. Make sure your environment variables (lib and include)
point to the right path. You'll need them to point to the Visual C directories
as well as the directories from the DirectX SDK. Once this is done, you are
ready to run MAKESTUF.BAT. I put an in-line makefile at the top of each source
file. This is why there is no "makefile" in the directory. Cool trick, eh?

You can compile the examples from the VC GUI environment as well, but you'll
need to create your own project if you do so. Here are some hints on setting it
up to compile Voxlap:

   * Be sure to specify these non-default compiler settings:
        /J   default char type is unsigned
        /TP  compile all files as .cpp (I incorrectly use .c to save typing :)

   * Add these libraries to your linker settings:
        ddraw.lib
        dinput.lib
        dxguid.lib

   * To compile V5.ASM, you'll need an assembler. I use MASM. I'm not quite
        sure how to set this up in the VC environment. To make things easier,
        I included V5.OBJ. You can add this to your project if you have
        trouble assembling V5.ASM.

To compile with VC Toolkit 2003:
   * Change the linker option: /MD to /ML
        (see top of GAME.C, SIMPLE.C, VOXED.C, KWALK.C)

   * To fix the "MSVCRT.LIB not found" error, in WINMAIN.CPP, change:
      #define USETHREADS 20
         To:
      #define USETHREADS 0

Requirements:

   CPU: Pentium III, Athlon, or above
   System memory: 128MB RAM or above
   Graphics card: Any old piece of junk should be fine :)
   OS: Microsoft Windows 98/ME/2K/XP
   DirectX 8.0 or above
   Compiler: Microsoft Visual C/C++ 6.0 or above.

   NOTE: WINMAIN.CPP uses SSE or 3DNow! instructions, so if you are compiling
   with VC6, you will need to install the Processor Pack (VCPP.ZIP). VCPP
   will only install over VC6 SP5 Professional edition, although I have had
   some success in fooling the installation program :) Fortunately, this is
   not an issue with VC7. You can also download a "free" version of the VC
   compiler: google for "c++ toolkit 2003". Unfortunately, it's missing a few
   files, such as WINDOWS.H and NMAKE.EXE, but they can be found elsewhere -
   either from the Platform SDK, or by googling for them.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
File description:

MAKESTUF.BAT: Quick&dirty batch file showing how to compile things at the
   command prompt.
SIMPLE.C: Minimalist sample code showing how to interface Voxlap. Study this
   code before looking at GAME.C. It should also be easier to start a new
   project from this code.
GAME.*: A big ugly testing ground for many Voxlap features. Think of this
   as the example code for most functions in VOXLIB.TXT.

VOXLAP5.H: Include file for VOXLAP5.C, V5.ASM, KPLIB.C
VOXLAP5.C: Voxlap engine C routines
V5.*: Voxlap engine assembler routines
KPLIB.C: Ken's Picture LIBrary. Decoding for: PNG,JPG,GIF,TGA,BMP,PCX and ZIP.
   This library can be used independently from the engine. Voxlap depends on
   this library for various functions.
WINMAIN.CPP: Windows layer (setup screen, sound, input). This code is
   independent of Voxlap and can be replaced if you want to use your own
   windows layer, such as SDL. I've been maintaining WINMAIN.CPP for years, so
   it is rather stable now.
SYSMAIN.H: Include file for my windows layer (WINMAIN)
VOXDATA.ZIP: Game data. You do not need to extract this data to run GAME.EXE,
   SIMPLE.EXE, or VOXED.EXE. You will need to extract it to select models for
   loading in KWALK though.

VOXED.*: My VXL voxel editor. I made UNTITLED.VXL using VOXED. There are a lot
   of keys to learn - so have patience. As a convenience, you can view the
   help file (VOXEDHLP.TXT) inside the editor by pressing F1.
KWALK.*: An animation editor for .KV6 voxel sprites using .KFA animations.
   You'll need to extract files from VOXDATA.ZIP to see my example models.

VXLFORM.TXT: Description of the VXL format
KWALKHLP.TXT: Help file for KWALK
VOXEDHLP.TXT: Help file for VOXED
VOXLIB.TXT: Help file for VOXLAP5, KPLIB, and WINMAIN.

Contact info:

If you do anything cool with Voxlap, I would love to hear about it! I prefer
that you contact me in either of these ways:

 1. Write about it on my personal forum ("advsys.net/ken" topic) at:
    http://www.jonof.id.au

 2. You can write me a private E-mail (address can be found at the bottom of
    my main page). Please use this for license requests.

If you have any questions or feature requests about other things in Voxlap, it
doesn't hurt to ask, although keep in mind that I haven't really worked on the
engine since 2003.
